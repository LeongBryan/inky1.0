Initial pygame project to learn coding.
Sadly, this was soon abandoned for a larger Unity game, which is published at Kongregate here:

Still, it's playable with the following steps:

1. git clone the project
2. pip install pygame
3. run main.py (main_initial.py also works, if you're interested in the evolution of the game...)
